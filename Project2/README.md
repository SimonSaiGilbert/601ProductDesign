phase1.py runs a function avg_favs_and_sentiment() which prompts the user for a Twitter handle and number of tweets to analyze. 
It then outputs the average number of favorites over all the tweets as well as the average sentiment score and magnitude.

In order to run this program, you must enter your Twitter API access credentials at the specified locations in the script.

phase2.py first prompts the user for the date in the format <YYYYMMDD> and returns a plot showing the sentiment of 8 of the top Super Smash Brothers Melee players' tweets over the course of that day. Super Smash Brothers Melee is my favorite video game of all time and an eSport that I follow religiously. I thought it would be fun to make this program, so you could enter the date of a major tournament, and see how the best players' sentiment changes over the course of that day. I'm curious if the sentiment will correspond to their placement in the tournament.
