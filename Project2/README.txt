testprog.py runs a function avg_favs_and_sentiment() which prompts the user for a Twitter handle and number of tweets to analyze. 
It then outputs the average number of favorites over all the tweets as well as the average sentiment score and magnitude.

In order to run this program, you must enter your Twitter API access credentials at the specified locations in the script.

Enjoy!
