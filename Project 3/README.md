I found two segmentation neural networks and decided to implement both. I did this because the implementations are relatively easy and because I wasn't sure which type of segmentation would be most useful for the term project.

## Implementing DeepLab Demo

The iPython Notebook DeepLab_Demo.ipynb runs an implementation of DeepLab to perform image segmentation on data from the PASCAL VOC dataset. The notebook runs in Google Colab and should run without any problems.

## Object Detection Demo

This .ipynb also runs easily in Google Colab and implements either FasterRCNN+InceptionResNet V2 or ssd+mobilenet V2 for object detection.

Both of these notebooks are very "plug-and-play". Enjoy!!
